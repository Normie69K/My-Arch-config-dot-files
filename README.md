# My Arch Config Dot Files

This repository contains the configuration files and settings for my Arch Linux setup. It includes various dotfiles and configuration files for system tools and applications such as Zsh, Vim, VSCode, and more. You can use these files as a reference or apply them to your own system setup.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Git
- Zsh (optional, if you want to use my Zsh configuration)
- Vim (optional)
- VSCode (optional)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Normie69K/My-Arch-config-dot-files.git
   cd My-Arch-config-dot-files
   ```

2. **Apply Dotfiles:**

   You can copy the dotfiles into the appropriate directories in your system. Here are the general steps:
   
   - **Zsh:** Copy the `.zshrc` file to your home directory.
     ```bash
     cp .zshrc ~/
     ```
   
   - **Vim:** Copy the `.vimrc` file to your home directory.
     ```bash
     cp .vimrc ~/
     ```

   - **VSCode:** If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can copy the `.vscode` folder to your VSCode settings directory.
     ```bash
     cp -r .vscode ~/.vscode
     ```

3. **Configure Zsh (if using Zsh):**
   - If you donâ€™t have `zsh` installed, install it first:
     ```bash
     sudo pacman -S zsh
     ```
   - Change the default shell to Zsh:
     ```bash
     chsh -s $(which zsh)
     ```

4. **Other Configuration Files:**
   - You can also find other configuration files for system tools and applications like GNOME, Android, and more. Adjust them to your preferences by copying them to the corresponding directories.

## Customizing

Feel free to modify these configurations to fit your needs. Add your custom aliases, plugins, or themes to the Zsh configuration, or adjust the Vim settings to make your development environment more efficient.

### Steps to Create the `README.md`:
1. In your project root directory, create a file named `README.md`.
2. Copy and paste the above template into that file.
3. Customize the sections as needed (e.g., add extra details about your setup or specific instructions for tools you are using).

Once you've added this file, you can commit and push it to your GitHub repository:

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README with setup instructions"
git push origin main
```
