# My Arch Config Dot Files

Welcome to my Arch Linux configuration repository! This repository contains all the dotfiles and configuration settings I use for a personalized Arch setup. It includes configurations for terminal applications like **Zsh**, **Kitty**, and **Catnap**, as well as general system settings and tools.

Feel free to use these files as-is or customize them to fit your own needs. This setup is designed to make your terminal experience fast, efficient, and visually appealing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- **Git** (for version control)
- **Zsh** (for a modern shell experience)

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Normie69K/My-Arch-config-dot-files.git
cd My-Arch-config-dot-files

2. Apply Dotfiles

You can now begin applying the various configuration files.

    Zsh Configuration: Zsh is my default shell, and it comes with custom configurations and plugins for efficiency and better auto-completion.

    To apply the Zsh configuration:

cp .zshrc ~/

Optional: If you want to use Oh-My-Zsh for even more customization and plugins, you can install it:

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

Kitty Terminal Configuration: Kitty is my terminal of choice for its speed and rendering capabilities. To use my custom Kitty configuration:

    Install Kitty:

sudo pacman -S kitty

Copy the Kitty config file:

    cp .config/kitty/kitty.conf ~/.config/kitty/

    Customization: Feel free to tweak the Kitty config to adjust colors, fonts, and other settings to your liking.

Catnap Configuration: Catnap is a lightweight tool that adjusts system settings to help save power when idle. To apply the Catnap configuration:

    Install Catnap:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/catnap.git ~/catnap
cd ~/catnap
make
sudo make install

Copy the catnap config file:

        cp .config/catnap/catnap.conf ~/.config/catnap/

        Optional: You can change its behavior by editing the catnap.conf file.

üñ•Ô∏è Customizing Your Setup

This repository is designed to be easily customizable. Here are some tips for making it your own:
Zsh Customization

    Add Aliases: You can add custom aliases in the .zshrc file to make your life easier. For example:

alias ll="ls -la"
alias gs="git status"

Install Plugins: The zshrc file comes with support for plugins like zsh-autosuggestions and zsh-syntax-highlighting. To install them:

    git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions
    git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ~/.zsh/zsh-syntax-highlighting

Kitty Customization

    Fonts & Colors: You can modify the terminal font and color scheme in the kitty.conf file. For example:

    font_family      Fira Code
    background       #282a36
    foreground       #f8f8f2

Catnap Customization

    Power Save Settings: If you want to fine-tune how Catnap manages power, simply edit the catnap.conf file:

    idle_timeout = 300  # 5 minutes
    cpu_scaling = on

üîß Additional Configuration Files

This repository also includes configurations for some of your favorite tools and applications:

    .vimrc: For Vim users, this file includes useful settings like line numbers and syntax highlighting. Copy it to your home directory:

cp .vimrc ~/

VSCode Settings: If you use VSCode, you can apply my custom workspace settings by copying the .vscode folder:

    cp -r .vscode ~/.vscode
